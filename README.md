# Project Background
This application was the culmination of work in the final year of my Software Engineering degree. We had to research, architect, project manage, task manage, develop and summarise an entire application
with a scope of our choosing, which was reviewed and approved by our project co-ordinator.

My project aimed to answer the question: Can a mobile application assist in the safety of employees visiting service users?

To achieve the goals set out in my proposal, I developed an ASP.Net Web Application with a built in Web API (Rest), with an accompanying mobile app to send and retrieve data from
the API.

The proposal can be found here: https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/FYP-AspNetWebApp/blob/master/Documentation/Project%20Proposal.pdf

# Research
I wrote an 11,299 word literature review that focused on a numnber of topics relevent to developing an application of this scope. The topics covered were:

- Facing the potential for harm at work (This application was designed for the safety of home visiting workers)
- Application Legality, Privacy and Ethics
  - Legal Implications
  - Ethical Considerations
  - Privacy
- Project Management Methodologies
  - Kanban
  - Scrum (Agile)
  - Waterfall
- User Experience (UX)
  - Human Centred Design (HCD)
  - Accessbility
  - User Interface
- Software Architectures
  - Monolith
  - Service Oritented Approach (SOA)
  - Microservices
- Mobile Languages
  - Xamarin
  - Flutter
  - React Native

# Technologies
The following is a summary of the technologies and packages that I used:

- Newtonsoft.Json
- SignalR (For realtime notifications)
- ASP.Net (WebApp and WebApi)
- Entity Framework 6
- Google JavaScript Maps API
- Xamarin Forms (For near native android functionality that allowed access to the sensors for GPS data)
- Boostrap 4, For a consistent front-end experience

# Project Management
I chose to use the Agile Methodology to complete this project, this provided a wealth of experience working to agile standards. Naturally this isn't a 100% faithful
following of the methodology as it was only myself developing the project.

# Architecting / Engineering
This application was designed before it was developed, giving a framework to follow in order to actually build the project.

# Outcome
This application was presented to two senior lecturers at the university, who assessed the researcg, functionality, documentation and project management of the application. 
I was awarded a first for the Final Year module and ultimately attained a First Class Degree.
